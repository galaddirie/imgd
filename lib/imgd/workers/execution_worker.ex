defmodule Imgd.Workers.ExecutionWorker do
  @moduledoc """
  Oban worker for executing workflows through the Runtime Execution Supervisor.

  ## Role in Architecture

  This is the **job queue entry point** — a thin wrapper that handles async/background job concerns:

  - Receives Oban jobs from the queue
  - Receives Oban jobs from the queue
  - Starts or attaches to execution processes via `Imgd.Runtime.Execution.Supervisor`
  - Monitors execution processes and waits for completion
  - Returns Oban-compatible results (:ok, {:error, ...})

  ## Configuration

  - Queue: `:executions`
  - Max attempts: 1 (failures are terminal, no automatic retries)
  - Unique: prevents duplicate jobs for same execution within 60 seconds
